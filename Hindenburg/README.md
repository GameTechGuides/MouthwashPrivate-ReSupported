# Hindenburg
Hindenburg is a completely customisable and scalable Among Us server, complete
with advanced plugins and a sophisticated and configurable anti-cheat.

With unparalleled support for [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor),
it's perfect for developers and for private modded game servers.

It uses [SkeldJS](https://github.com/skeldjs/SkeldJS) to interface with the Among Us
protocol, as well as keeping state.

### üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Server-As-A-Host

### üé® Highly Configurable
Hindenburg is completely customisable with a simple json file, giving you full
control.

### üß© Plugins
Leveraging the power of SkeldJS, Hindenburg has full knowledge of running games,
giving you the ability to write or easily install plugins to control the behaviour
of the server.

### üß¨ Reactor Support
Hindenburg also natively supports clients using [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor),
allowing plugins to communicate directly with mods, and giving you the ability
to leverage the full potential of the Reactor protocol.

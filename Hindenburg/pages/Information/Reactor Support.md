Hindenburg provides native support for [Reactor](https://reactor.gg), a client-side
modding framework, used by many developers and public mods.

### Configuration
{@page Installation | If you're running a server yourself}, you'll find that Hindenburg provides great support all-round for Reactor, {@page Configuration | with configuration options to ensure players are using Reactor}, *and* the correct mods, even allowing you to ban certain mods and requiring specific versions for mods that you allow.

Hindenburg also gives you access to see the mods of specific players, with [excellent logging](/Using%20Hindenburg/Logs) when they connect and an [interactive CLI to check up on them](/Using%20Hindenburg/Interactive%20CLI#list-mods).

### Plugin Support
Hindenburg also works great with client-side mods made with Reactor, [as it provides a native reactor rpc API](/Plugins/Reactor%20Integration) for plugins, allowing them to communicate directly with mods of specific players, or to entire rooms.
